Hi there and welcome to my site. This site is a collection of my personal
projects and thoughts. I started this website in 2013 because I was learning HTML
and CSS and decided to build a website to apply my learning. Currently this site
is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

Currently, I am a Product Manager for Amazon Web Services. Before Amazon Web Services,
I worked in analytical roles in the digital advertising and educational nonprofit space.
