I have not been consistent with updating my site and I hope today is the beginning
of the end of 5 years of stasis for my site. At the moment, I do not plan to add
posts regularly but instead update or replace old posts with more content. I am
not sure if this will work well, but I believe the format will fit the content I
want to have on my site. I am still learning Jekyll so the appearance and formatting
of my site may change a few more times before I settle on a style I like.
