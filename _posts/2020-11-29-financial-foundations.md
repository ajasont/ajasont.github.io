title: "Financial Foundations"

I learned frugality from my mother, but my mother's frugality was entirely optimized around not spending money. Although I am grateful for the frugal foundation, after starting my first post-university job I learned frugality is just the first step towards a strong financial foundation and financial freedom. My mother never took the next steps to start optimizing how to spend and save efficiently so I had to learn on my own. Back in 2013, I knew my situation was not unique and realized many of my brothers' and friends' were in a similar situation so I arguably "bullied" my brothers and any friends who would listen to open cash back credit cards, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and high yield savings accounts. I stopped proselytizing index funds, credit card bonuses, and a bunch of other personal finance stuff I had learned around 2015, but now that my younger cousins are growing up and reaching or past 18 years old I find myself having the same conversations again. So the following is a guide to my younger cousins on how to move beyond their parents' method of simply saving money.

## Frugal Foundation ##
All my following advice requires you to be able to save money. You do not have to save all of your money. Money is meant to be spent so enjoy your money, just be prudent and put some away to enjoy in the future.

### Checking Account ###
*Why should I open a checking account?*

The checking account serves 3 main purposes
1. To deposit your cash from your parents, paychecks, and red envelopes
1. To pay credit card bills
1. To transfer money to a high yield savings account

*What should I be careful of?*
1. Monthly account fee: some checking accounts have a monthly fee. Usually you can get the fee waived (you do not have to pay the fee) by meeting certain conditions like having a certain amount of money in the account. This is one of the reasons why you need to save enough money since if you take money out and go below the threshold you will owe a fee each month and then you need more money to get back above the threshold to waive the fee. 
1. ATM fees. You will receive a debit card with your checking account which you can use at an ATM to withdraw money. If you use your debit card at an ATM that belongs to your bank then you will not have to pay a fee, but sometimes you might need cash and cannot find an ATM for your bank. Usually if you withdraw money from an ATM that does not belong to your bank, then you will have to pay an extra fee. The ATM will tell you that you what the fee is so at least you will know how much the service will cost you. Some checking accounts do include debit cards that are ATM fee free, but I do not believe any major banks (e.g. Chase, Bank of America, Citi, or Wells Fargo) do. 
1. Overdraft fees. Overdraft is when you try to use your debit card and either spend more money than you have in your bank account or try to withdraw more money than you have in your account at an ATM. When you open your account, the banker will ask you if you want overdraft protection I recommend you say **No, I do not want overdraft protection**. You will never be charged an overdraft fee, but your card will also be rejected if you try to spend more than you have. 
1. **Never use your debit card except at an ATM.** This advice is a lot easier to follow once you have a credit card. But if you do not have a credit card, try to always withdraw cash with your debit card at an ATM to pay for stuff instead of paying by debit. The main reason you should not use your debit card ever except at ATMs is for security. Your debit card is directly linked to your checking account and when you buy something the money is removed immediately from your bank account. All the restaurants and shops you might use your debit card at probably do not have good data security. If your debit card information and money is stolen, you *probably will* be able to get your money back after calling your bank and waiting while they investigate, but remember **it is always easier to keep your money than to get it back**. I will come back to this point when
I get to credit cards.
1. You might be asked if you want to open a savings account. Feel free to say no here if you'd like. Most major banks do not offer a competitive interest rate. More on this in the high yield savings account section. 

*How do I pick a checking account?*
The path of least resistance is to open a checking account in the same bank as your parents. That said here are some guidelines in order of importance:
* Fee-free or easily waiveable fee. Paying a monthly fee for a checking account is the opposite of saving. 
* Convenient physical locations and ATMs so that depositing and withdrawing cash is much easier
* Sign up bonus. Sometimes banks run promotions where they will offer money to encourage people to sign up for a checking account. The bonuses usually require a direct deposit so you will have to have a job that has direct deposit setup.
* Decent fee-free cashback credit cards because having a checking account may help you get approved for the bank's credit cards
* No ATM fee. This one is rare, but some smaller banks and credit unions do offer 

*What do you recommend?*
I have a slight bias towards Chase because they tend to have a lot of locations and ATMs and good credit cards since having a checking relationship may help with getting those cards. The downside of Chase is there are usually conditions you have to fulfill to avoid a monthly fee, but there is a relatively easy minimum balance one. Chase occasionally runs sign up bonuses as well.

### High Yield Savings Account (under construction) ###
The savings account serves 3 main purposes:
1. Interest each month to start building wealth
1. Emergency fund
1. Parking spot for money until you are ready to start investing

A high yield savings account is a savings account that gives you a higher rate than what you get from most banks you see in the real world (e.g. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.) **DO NOT** put your money into a savings account with these banks. The yearly interest rate for most of the major banks is 0.01% which means $1000 only earns $1 per year. Most high yield accounts offer an interest rate of at least 0.x% meaning $1000 will earn at least $10 or more per year. The only "oddity" with the high yield savings accounts is that almost all of them are online only. This is not a problem. There are 0 These online banks are all FDIC insured   

You will very likely need to open the high yield savings account with an online bank. 
The most banks offer a horrible interest rate on savings accounts.
