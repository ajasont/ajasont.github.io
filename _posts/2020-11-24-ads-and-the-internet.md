Ads finance the internet. And that's why I think almost everyone in tech should spend some time working in ad tech if possible or at least know the basics. I am obviously biased after working 4 years in ad tech, which honestly is not a lot of time because ad tech is a massive iceberg and I have barely scratched the surface. Despite my admitted ignorance, I hope to provide a primer on digital advertising and highlight the depth and breadth of digital advertising. One clarifying definition, when I refer to advertisers I mean a business like an electronics repair store, an insurance company, or a shoe brand.

I want to start with my favorite data points.
* Google and Facebook are both in the top 5 largest US companies by market cap
* ~80% of Google's revenue and ~95%+ of Facebook's revenue comes from digital advertising
* Google makes ~$40-50 per click on Search ads for words like insurance or lawyer

As far as I know historically, no other company that dependent on advertising revenue has ever reached such lofty market cap positions. Even further, there is gobs of money in digital advertising if 2 companies dependent on digital advertising revenue can both share a pie. On a more personal note, I learned that Google made $40-50 per click on some search ads shortly after I started working in ad tech and was shocked anyone would pay so much for a simple click. What was wilder is the ~$40-50 is not a price set by Google directly, but instead by advertisers who had bid up to that price. So from a financial standpoint, digital advertising is clearly "valuable" and much more so than previous forms of advertising. So why is digital advertising so "valuable"?

**The goal of advertising is simply to reach and engage the right person at the right time and place.** Digital advertising improves each aspect of the goal compared to traditional advertising. I want to start with attribution or knowing you have achieved the goal above. Attribution is the ability to tie together the narrative that someone on the internet saw the ad, clicked the ad, was routed to a relevant page, and ultimately made a business decision. For example, Google can provide data to their advertiser that can show I searched for "car insurance", clicked one of their ads, and then bought their insurance policy. Typically, ad tech companies can go further and show even though I may not have clicked the ad, I was definitely exposed to the ad before buying the insurance policy and may partially attribute the purchase to the ad. Advertising is an investment for advertisers and better attribution allows an advertiser to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of their advertising spend. Using your browsing data for attribution is one part of how companies "sell" your data. Traditional advertising methods do not typically have the level of granularity that ad tech companies can provide. For example, a business advertising with highway billboards may see a rise in customers from the areas they paid for billboard ads, but unless they ask each customer how they discovered the business and each customer is fully self aware and remembers whether or not they saw the billboard, confidently attributing the customer's business to the billboard is tricky. Digital attribution data allows businesses to calculate a more clear ROI whereas the calculation for traditional methods can be difficult.
