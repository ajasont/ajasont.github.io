    Hi there and welcome to my site. I started this site in 2013 as a way to learn HTML and CSS and I had so much fun I decided to use it to share snippets of my life. I will try to add more features and push more visual updates in the future as I learn more.                   </font></p>

    <b>October 3rd, 2015 - There and Back Again, Portland</b>

    I did not do much on Friday night because I stayed at work till about 7 pm. I am trying to learn as much as I can right now because Quarter 4 is supposed to be a really busy and hectic time and I wanted to be of as much help as possible.
                </p>

   On Saturday, I went to Portland to see a friend who was participating in a marathon.  I woke up around 6 am and went to Seattle's King Street Station where the smell unplesantly reminded me of New York City's Port Authority. I had some yogurt as breakfast before I got on the bus. The yogurt is a local brand that I really like. The yogurt tastes a bit like cheesecake so I wonder how healthy it really is compared to plainer ones. They have some really good looking flavors that I have not tried yet but will when I visit their actual storefront, right now I buy it from Whole Foods due to the Apple Pay bonus. The yogurt is called Ellenos for those who want to google some pictures.

    In Portland, I mostly followed my friend and his friends around. Luckily, I was able to go to a good number of places that my friend recommended. Unfortunately, she gave me her recommendations after I got back to Seattle but many of the things we had done in Portland were on her list. I did not take as many pictures on this trip as I would have liked to partially because I wanted to spend more time taking in the sights but really I am not in the habit of taking many photos yet but hopefully I will be in the future. Anyways some pictures of highlights:

    After meeting up for brunch, we got donuts and then walked and shopped around a bit until we came across Powell's City of Books. This bookstore had a lot of books, a lot, So many that the book store takes up the entire block. See that block in Google Maps image I added, that's all the bookstore. Afterwards, we roamed around and we walked across a few interesting sights, we made our way through Portland's Chinatown, passed by a tent city called Right to Dream Too, and also passed through the Portland Saturday Market. We ended up getting Portland's version of chicken and rice at a restaurant called Nong's Khao Man Gai. It is not the same as Halal Guys, instead of it is Thai chicken and rice. I liked it and it is only $1 or so more than New York City's. I would definitely go again. A mid-day coffee break followed.

    After coffee, we headed to get ice cream at a place called Salt and Straw. I got their classic sea salt and caramel flavor and snickerdoodle. I liked it and would like to go back and try out a few more flavors. Anyways with a full stomach and quite sleepy from all the walking and eating, I caught my bus back to Seattle, ending my day trip to Portland.

    Sunday was mostly errands. I went to Macy's in an attempt to get some crazy cash back with Apple Pay and Discover 5% categories but it appears Macy's is refusing Apple Pay with a Discover card. I ended up using a coupon that a friend sent me and buying some towels, some dinnerware, and a trash can. I ended up spending an hour trying to find a perfect $50 pre-total so I could use the coupon while only buying items that I could not get for less elsewhere. The hunt for value really exhausted me. Anyways next weekend, I hope to explore Seattle's Chinatown and International District since I saw the Chinatown gate while I was heading home from the bus station on Saturday night.
