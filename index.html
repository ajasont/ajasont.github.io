<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello World!</h1>
<p>
  So hopefully you are here because I know you from real life and I shared the url with you as opposed to a random
  stranger happening upon this barebone page of mine. No matter following are a few of my hopes and plans for this site
  please don't laugh at me :(
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Most importantly of all, have lots of fun learning new things</li>
  <li>A blog aka a place to feed my own ego although hopefully that means you don't have to deal with it in person</li>
  <li>A nice resume site after I improve my website design and professional skills significantly</li>
  <li>A place to share the images and my thoughts of my fitness progress when I get to where I would like to be</li>
  <li>A playground for me to try out any new website related things I happen to see/read about it</li>
</ol>
