    Hi there and welcome to my site. I started this site in 2013 as a way to learn HTML and CSS and I had so much fun I decided to use it to share snippets of my life. I will try to add more features and push more visual updates in the future as I learn more. 
            </p>
<p>
    Below are links to how I spent my various weekends since moving to Seattle. Common themes are my trying something that I have wanted to do since adolscence but never did for various reasons or enjoying something that I missed while in New York City.
