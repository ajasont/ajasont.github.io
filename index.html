                    Hi there and welcome to my site. I started this site in 2013 as a way to learn HTML and CSS and I had so much fun I decided to use it to share snippets of my life. I will try to add more features and push more visual updates in the future as I learn more.

                    So I just finished my first week of work and my stuff finally arrived so I spent Friday night and most of Saturday just unpacking. Here are some photos I took.

    Hopefully once I am all settled in I can take a few nicer pictures without all the boxes. Regardless I am really relieved my pillow and futon are here as I did not find the inflatable mattress very comfortable without a real pillow. I am also really enjoyed excited that my skillet arrived as my meals for the entire week had been roast turkey and spinach on white bread, a royal gala apple, and some yogurt since I did not have my cookware. This was the first time I had seen yogurt come in a 4 lb. tub and I had to buy it. For Friday night dinner, I unpacked my cookware, cooked some sausages and ate it with this local salsa and some tortilla chips. The salsa was okay but not as spicy as I had hoped. On Saturday, I decided to try one of Seattle's cheap eats and went to a burger place called Dick's. Their double patty burger costs $3.40 and I would say it sits somewhere between McDonalds and Carl's Jr. Nevertheless, I quite enjoyed it .

    On Sunday, I went with a few friends to the Apple Store in Seattle's University District to buy myself an iPhone. I needed my friend to come along so I could take advantage of the Discover and Apple Pay promotion. I am pretty excited to give the iPhone a try as my Nexus 4's battery would go from 90% to 15% after a 30 minute Uber ride. The Nexus 4 was my first smart phone and lasted me almost 3 years so I will probably keep it around to use as a mini-tablet. Anyways we got lunch at this udon restaurant. I tried their curry udon and it was pretty heavy. The pictures at the udon restaurant were taken with my phone since I forgot to bring my camera with me. Anyways I am going to Portland next weekend and am quite excited to see what Portland has to offer.
