        <p>
		So hopefully you are here because I know you from real life and I shared the url with you as opposed to a random
		stranger happening upon this barebone page of mine. No matter following are a few of my hopes and plans for this site
		please don't laugh at me :(
        </p>
	   <ol>
		  <li>Most importantly of all, have lots of fun learning new things</li>
		  <li>A blog aka a place to feed my own ego although hopefully that means you don't have to deal with it in person</li>
		  <li>A nice resume site after I improve my website design and professional skills significantly</li>
		  <li>A place to share the images and my thoughts of my fitness progress when I get to where I would like to be</li>
		  <li>A playground for me to try out any new website related things I happen to see/read about it</li>
	   </ol>
