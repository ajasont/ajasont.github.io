<center><b>October 17th, 2015 - Market and Mall</b></center>
<p>
    On Friday night, my key fob stopped working and the leasing office was already closed so I could not get into my apartment building on my own. Luckily, I was able to sneak in behind another resident, although I did not enjoy the feeling of having to stay in my apartment until the next morning. On a more positive note, my shower curtain came in and added a healthy amount of color to my bathroom.

    On Saturday morning, I got up to run a few errands before meeting up with some friends. We walked over to Seattle's Pike Place Market, an outdoor area with lots of nifty shops and apparently a lot of history that I will try to learn about later when I explore it further (for example, the first Starbucks ever is here). I intend to visit many more times in the future as the market is a short walk from my apartment and there are many interesting stores I would like to browse.

    My goal this visit was breadbowl and seafood chowder. I have never eaten a breadbowl before and every time I saw one growing up I wanted to try it. As for why seafood chowder, I want to add more seafood to my diet and Seattle supposedly has good seafood. Anyways before we got to the chowder place, we grabbed some piroshky as a coworker had recommended that I try it. Piroshky is an Eastern European bun stuffed with filling. I got a beef and cheese one and really liked it.

    I ended up not getting a breadbowl because we got a chowder sampler to share instead. I saw a few patrons' breadbowl and it looked really disappointing so I am glad my friends convinced me to not get the breadbowl. I was extra excited for the breadbowl because the bread was sourdough but turns out you can just grab the leftover bread they scoop out of the loaf for breadbowls to eat with your soup so I still got to eat some sourdough. After we finished our chowder, my friend gave us a tour of her office and we had some of their free snacks. I am pretty envious of the free snacks especially the yogurt, fruit, and nuts. Once we had our fill, we hopped on a bus to go to Northgate mall to do some shopping.

    We spent quite a lot of time in the mall and although, I did not buy anything, I found it really interesting to be back in a suburban mall. True to the mall experience, we got dinner in the food court. I had Taco Bell for the first time in probably over 5 years? I decided to try their Hot Habanero and Fiery Ghost Pepper Dare Devil Loaded Grillers. The Hot Habanero was very disappointing and I don't remember tasting any habanero and did not find it particulary spicy. I did find the Fiery Ghost Pepper a little bit spicy though. I did go in with low expectations though as I do not expect either loaded grillers to be popular if they actually had habanero or ghost pepper. I think the spiciness of the loaded grillers were well made for people with less spicy tolerance and could be really enjoyable. We went back to one of my friend's apartments and just chatted for a while afterwards. I got home pretty late and began to think I might have to ask my friend if I could stay at her place since I had not gotten my key fob replaced yet and still couldn't get into my apartment building. It was late enough that I was not sure another resident would enter before morning. Luckily, after a few minutes another resident did and I was able to get in.

    On Sunday, I went to the leasing office to replace my key fob and afterwards went to Uwajimaya (Japanese grocery store from last weekend) and bought about 15 pounds of pork ribs because the ribs were part of their weekly sale and the grocery store was also having a 10% off everything promotion for their 87th anniversary which stacked with the weekly sale price. I slow cooked the ribs and intend to eat it for the rest of the week. I stocked up on meat because during the prior week, I had actually run out of chicken and started eating rice with bacon and mozzarella cheese. The combination is strange but I thought the mix was tasty. Definitely not something I would serve to guests but I had fun trying out the combination.
