<p>    Fall is here and rainy season in Seattle has begun. Over the past week, I have been feeling a bit cold and so I made some pork broth with kale to keep myself warm and healthy. </p>

<p>    I spent all of Saturday in Bellevue. In the morning, my friends and I got dim sum with my cousin and his friends. Afterwards, my friends and I went to Bellevue Square because we wanted to check out the new Uniqlo that had just opened up. We spent a good chunk of the day in the mall checking out the stores. I didn't buy anything but really just enoyed the break. The mall is really quite nice. It felt more luxurious compared to the Northgate mall from a few weekends ago. </p>

    For dinner, we went to a nearby Japanese-Korean restaurant where I had some curry. The post dinner plan was to bus to Mox, the board game store from a previous weekend, in order to regroup with my cousin and play some board games. Unfortunately, I got us stranded by boarding the wrong bus and my cousin had to drive over and pick us up. We did make it to the Mox though and played 2 games. One was a card based game called Coup and the second a scenario building board game called Betrayal at House on the Hill. Coup is a pretty fast game to pick up and rounds can go by quick but it is still fun nonetheless. Betrayal at House on the Hill has a lot of build up time before the action begins. I had a lot of fun playing the both games. Overall, I liked Bellevue except the city is more spread out than downtown Seattle and getting around without a car is difficult.</p><br>

<p>Sunday was a trip up to the University District (where University of Washington is located). The intent was to visit the Amazon bookstore which is a physical location where you can buy books for the same price as it is on Amazon. First was lunch at Thai Tom. The restaurant is quite tiny which is probably why you get to watch the chef cook your meal in front of you. It was a cool experience and I liked it but I do wish my dish came out spicier. Next, we went to Amazon Books and I thought the store was very cool. I was quite excited to check out the new $50 Fire tablets. For $50, I was really curious about just how good the tablet would be. To be honest, the tablets did not seem half bad. I would strongly consider one if I did not already have a tablet. Anyways we stopped by for some Molly Moon's ice cream a local Seattle ice cream store. For once, I was actually disappointed by vanilla, however, their earl grey was very tasty. I am definitely intrigued by some of their other flavors and plan to try the rest of their flavors. Nevertheless,    maybe you can see the crushing disappointment in my face on the photo below.</p>
