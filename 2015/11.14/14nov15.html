    I bought a bicycle! My bicycle is a 2015 All-City Space Horse in British Racing Green and this is the bicycle on my balcony.

    I have wanted a bicycle for about a decade and now at long last, I have one. I am just so happy. Over the years, I told myself to be patient and wait for the right moment while making many excuses about why buying one would be an imprudent decision. The right moment has finally come and I am thrilled. For now, I primarily intend to commute to work but after becoming more comfortable with riding, I plan to take to Seattle's bicycling trails.

    As a kid, I really enjoyed riding around with my brothers in our cul-de-sac. I especially relish the embarassing memories like riding into a parked car, hitting a curb straight on and subsequently getting launched into some bushes, or being on a head to head collison course with my older brother only to have our front tires perfectly bump and neither of us take a spill. Unfortunately, I have not ridden a bicycle much since I outgrew those childhood bicycles. I wanted one in high school so I could get around without having to rely on my parents but I lacked the determination and money. By the time I had the money, I could drive and was leaving for college. I had also considered buying one in college but given Ithaca's weather and geography, the decision seemed unwise. I began seriously reading up on bicycles in NYC and was strongly considering buying one but concerns about my safety hung heavily on me.

     Now that I am in Seattle, a seemingly more bicycle friendly city, the time is right. I actually went to the bicycle store last Sunday (11/08) because I was nearby after checking out the Amazon Books store, saw the Space Horse, gave it a test ride, saw it was on sale and went back Monday (11/09) night after work to buy. I was a bit worried about having to ride the 7 miles home at night because as I mentioned earlier I have not ridden a bicycle much since grade school. I really enjoyed the ride home though as I rode along a trail that had some nice views of Lake Union. Unfortunately, I had to stop once or twice because my leg cramped or I was lost but overall I was just overwhelmed with enjoyment from just riding my bicycle.
