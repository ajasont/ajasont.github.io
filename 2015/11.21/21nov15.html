<center><b>November 21st, 2015 - Visitor from the North</b></center>       
<p>
    A friend came down from Canada to visit me this weekend. No pictures but I did have a lot of fun walking all over downtown Seattle with him. Unfortunately, we did not do as much as I would have hoped, for which I am partly to blame. I fell off my bicycle and brusied my right shoulder and right knee. I will have to be more careful in the future. Anyways if you ever read this friend, thanks for visiting and I will try to visit sometime next year!
