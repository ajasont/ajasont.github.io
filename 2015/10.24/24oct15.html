<center><b>October 24th, 2015 - One Month Milestone</b></center>
<p>
    I finished the first month of my new job this week and really enjoying the job so far. Anyways moving onto the weekend, on Friday night, I had dinner in Bellevue and got to check out a really cool board game store called Mox, where I believe you can borrow any board game they sell for free. Unfortunately, I did not bring my camera so no pictures.

    Saturday and Sunday were both very quiet as I am still cleaning up the boxes in my apartment while ordering more household items. I want to find a use for them besides just flattening them and recycling.

    As I mentioned last week, I bought about 15 lbs. of spare ribs so I have been experimenting a bit. After I slow cook the ribs and remove the rib bones, I either glaze the pork with barbeque sauce or pan fry with some spinach. I bought 2 different barbeque sauces since I was not sure how much I needed for 15 lbs. Anyways the first sauce (Bone Suckin' Hot) was a disappointment because I did not find it very spicy. I hope the other sauce (Rufus Teague Blazin' Hot) can satisfy my spicy craving. One thing that I did find that does a great job satisfying that craving is Paqui's Haunted Ghost Pepper chips. Unlike last week's Taco Bell Ghost Pepper griller, these chips are really spicy and ghost pepper powder is listed in the ingredients label. And I believe it because I start feeling the burn in about 3 chips. Anyways I definitely want more and am going to try and find a place where I can buy them for cheaper. Unfortunately, Whole Foods charges ~$6 per bag compared to ~$3 for the companies' other flavors. I tried their Salsa Verede and Grilled Habanero flavors and was also very impressed.
