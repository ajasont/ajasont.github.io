    I spent Christmas in Seattle. I stopped by the grocery store on the 23rd to pick up some groceries to last me through the holidays. Since moving to Seattle, I have enjoyed trying out different regional brands the most. For example, I bought 8 pounds of Tillamook (Oregon based dairy farm) cheese this week. The plan for most of the cheese is to just work it into my meals like the ground beef bowl pictured below.

  On both Christmas Eve and Christmas day, I had hot pot with my cousin and his friends. I remember not liking hot pot much as a child and teenager but the experience has really grown on me after the few times I went with my friends in New York City. My insides also always feel so clean after the post hot pot restroom visit. Anyways, I was also introduced to a new chili pepper shell snack (pictured below). They were very tasty but unfortunately, not spicy at all. And by that I mean I do not think most people will find these spicy, not "This was spicy but not spicy enough for me to enjoy". Regardless, I still enjoyed the snack because of the sesame taste. Hot pot both times was followed by some fun board games. For my first Christmas in Seattle, I had fun.
