<center><b>October 10th, 2015 - Down to Chinatown</b></center>
            
<p>
    I went down to Seattle Chinatown-International District this weekend to buy some groceries and explore a bit. While I was visiting a variety of Asian grocery stores to do some price comparisons, I realized I quite enjoy grocery shopping. As a child, I dreaded how boring it was to wait while my mom bought groceries but now that I get to pick what to buy and cook, I look forward to grocery shopping every week.

    I visited quite a few Chinese grocery stores and was on my way to check out a Japanese one when I noticed a familar sign.

    It turns out that Kinokuya also has a physical store in Seattle and it brought up fond memories of their New York City location. Even better was that the Kinokuya is directly connected to Uwajimaya, the Japanese grocery store I was looking for.

    The Japanese grocery store was a bit more expensive than the Chinese grocery stores but it stocked Smith Brothers Farm milk which is something I had wanted to try after hearing about it. You can sign up to have Smith Brothers Farm deliver milk to your home on a schedule and I was really interested in trying out their service because I was curious if their milk tasted better than standard milk but unfortunately they do not deliver to apartments.

    The chocolate milk was tasty but not anything particularly special. I also bought a carton of their whole milk out of curiosity. as well as some bacon. I hope to season my cast iron with the leftover bacon grease. I went home afterwards pretty satisfied and of the 3 grocery stores I visited this one was my favorite because it reminded me of Southern California's large Asian grocery stores. I really missed those while I was in New York City as the grocery stores are often cramped and smaller as many stores in New York City tend to be. I can't wait to come back and buy some more groceries.
