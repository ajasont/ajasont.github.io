<center><b>December 12th, 2015 - Sweets and Shaves</b></center>

<p>
 I did not do much this weekend. I met up with my cousin for dinner in Seattle's International District/Chinatown. We ate some honey toast for dessert afterwards.

    On a different note, with No Shave November over I am so happy to be shaving regularly again. I actually shaved last week but do not have a photo of myself from last weekend. Anyways, I decided to try traditional wet shaving. I do not really have a lot of facial hair and did not mind how using cartridge razors that much but I wanted to try tradtional wet shaving out after reading about other people's experience. My hope is to turn shaving from a mostly boring routine to an enjoyable relaxing routine. I am happy so far despite each shave taking longer and being a bit messier. The pleasant smelling soap I am using alone has made me happier.
