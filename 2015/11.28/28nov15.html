<center><b>November 28th, 2015 - Thanksgiving 2015</b></center>
<br>
<p>
    I stayed in Seattle for Thanksgiving. I think in the last 7 years I have had Thanksgiving with my family only once and that was in 2012. I am feeling a little bit better since my bicycle accident but still not 100%. Unfortunately, other parts of my life have become a bit of a mess like my apartment and my gym routine. The weekend was mostly mild as I rest up. On Saturday, I went with some friends to a hot pot place called Boiling Point.

As you may have noticed from the pictures, I have been participating in No Shave November, which is about raising awareness for prostate cancer. Somehow that message was lost as No Shave November became common. Anyways I cannot wait for next week when I can finally shave.
