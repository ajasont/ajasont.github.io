<center><b>December 19th, 2015 - Copycat Caliburger</b></center>
<br>
<p>
    I met up with my cousin again this weekend and we headed off to Fremont to check out Warby Parker (first picture) because he wanted to buy new frames. We also ended up checking out a nearby bookstore that has a store cat (second picture) and also a store rabbit (not pictured, it was too shy).

   Eventually, we ended up at Caliburger. A few months ago, I read that there was a Shanghai based In-N-Out copycat coming to Seattle and my curiosity and appetite were piqued. I learned earlier this week, that despite a few delays, Caliburger had opened at last and here I am with their double double. The burger was not bad but I did not like it as much as I enjoyed In-N-Out. Part of this might be because I usually ask for a toasted bun at In-N-Out but I did not ask if Caliburger even had this option. I also felt this burger had less lettuce compared to In-N-Out but that might just be some rose tinted nostalgia glasses. I am a bit conflicted on the copyright but overall Caliburger was okay and good for a cheap burger fix.
