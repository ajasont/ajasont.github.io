   A high school friend was visiting Seattle this weekend and I did not take many pictures. Everything that follows is just a summary of the weekend which probably belongs more in my journal than this site.

    On Saturday morning, we took the Boeing tour where you walk through their factory/hangar and hear about how their planes are built. Overall the tour was about an hour and a half but oddly felt really short. The Boeing tour also does not allow cell phones or cameras so definitely no pictures here. After that was a lot of walking as we ate out way to and through the University district's farmer's market. A good chunk of Seattle was covered like Pike's Place, Seattle Central Library, Pioneer Square, International District/Chinatown, and even Bellevue. We ended the night at Mox the board game shop. I happen to find myself ending the night there often. I hope my friend and his friends all had fun because I did.

    Sunday consisted of waking up, riding around on my biycycle, buying some groceries, and then eating dinner with my cousin and his friends in Bellevue. Seattle's weather has turned very grey with some steady rainfall. Unfortunately to match this dreary weather, I had my very first iPhone drop and now have some scuffs and a negligible screen crack on the black bottom of my phone. I am mostly okay at the damage as I did choose to not use a case. Anyways I hope I take more pictures in the upcoming weekends.
