My weekend was mostly like the Superbowl game. Mostly quiet and without much action. I got up early on Saturday and rode to my bike shop for a scheduled bike fitting. I have to say after getting the adjustments, I feel much more comfortable on my bicycle and the ride back home was really pleasant. I snapped a few pictures of my trip back through Fremont (a neighborhood of Seattle) on my way back home. Afterwards, I ate some Vietnamese food with my brother and cousin and then we spent the rest of the afternoon and the evening playing board games. I thought I would never get exhausted of board games but I think I am burnt out on board games. I may be in a bit of a general slump recently. My entries are getting shorter as well. Anyways hopefully I can write or do something of interest next weekend.
