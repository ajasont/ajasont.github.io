<center><b>January 2nd, 2016 - New Years 2016</b></center>
<br>
<p>
   2015 was quite a year especially with a new job and a new city. I am looking forward to what I will get myself into in 2016. So far, my 2016 is off to a good start but first, I like to make a few simple and easy New Year resolutions and here are a few of 2016's.
    <ol><li>Be more active outdoors</li>
        <li>Learn computer programming</li>
        <li>Add something else to this site besides how I passed the weekend</li>
            </ol>
                </p>

  On New Years day, I went snowboarding so I am off to a good start on resolution 1. I have not gone snowboarding in about 6 years but thanks to my cousin and his girlfriend's coaching I was able to get to the bottom of a blue square by the end of the day. Last time, I tried to go down a blue square, the story ended differently. I was a bit concerned as my right knee and arm still feel fragile because of the bicycle fall a few weeks ago. I did not feel too much pain on my right arm and knee when I fell so I hope to go back a few more times this year to improve. I still do not feel comfortable going very fast yet and there were a few parts of the blue square slope where I did not generate enough momentum to carry me through a flat area and I had to walk through the landing. Anyways after snowboarding, we went to had hot pot for dinner and despite the hot pot from last week, I was very happy. The clean inside feeling afterwards felt like a great way to start the new year.

   I met up with my cousin again the next day to get brunch and check out the REI garage sale. We went to a place nearby my workplace called Serious Biscuit. I have not yet eaten any biscuits and gravy that I thought were absolutely delicious but this one was pretty close because of the egg, bacon, and fried chicken. Anyways after the meal, we swung by REI but there was a dreadfully long line (poorly pictured ahove) so we went to play board games at Card Kingdom/Mox which is the board game cafe/shop I mentioned in previous weeks. We did circle back to REI in the evening though and grabbed ourselves some hiking shoes. The pair I got was only $9 and is part of the plan to be more active outdoors. Hopefully when Seattle gets warmer, I can go on a hike.

    The night ended in a Morrocan restaurant called Marrakesh. The restaurant was a bit dim but I think the dimness created a better ambiance. We ordered the royal feast which was a 6 dish meal. The picture above shows the 4 entrees of the feast. Not pictured is a salad, a meat pie with powdered sugar (really tasty), some milk pudding, and a delightful warm mint tea. This weekend has been a great way to start 2016.
