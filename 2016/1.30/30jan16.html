So I took Friday off to go to the doctor for a wellness visit. I got a flu shot for the first time in my adulthood. I realized my inconsistent vaccinations thanks to a friend a few months back. I am vaccinated for the scarier but rarer (thanks to vaccination) diseases like tetanus but I do not get vaccinated for the most common diseases. I still have not felt so sick I could not get out of bed except for maybe twice in my childhood but I assume with enough time I will. Anyways with a clean bill of health I was off to Vegas for a friend's birthday party weekend.

Vegas was fun. I stayed at Excalibur and more importantly got to see my high school friends! I enjoyed time at the buffets, learning craps, a Cirque du Soleil show, and some rejection at the club. Overall, a great weekend trip. In other news, my older brother moved to Seattle and is currently living with me. I went to pick him up at the nearest bus station on Thursday night and then left off to Vegas. I am suspicious that he intentionally set his flight into Seattle to coincide with my Vegas trip as I did tell him the details but I am over that now. I hope I made the right decision.
