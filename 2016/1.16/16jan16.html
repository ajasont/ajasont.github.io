I ran more personal errands this weekend in the form of medical visits and will probably take care of a few more next week. On a different note, I have been spending some time thinking about how to make my site more entertaining as narrating my weekends is mundane. To start, I will try this new format with a few bullet points up top to recount some happenings during my week and weekend and then just some thoughts below that hopefully will be more interesting. This week will be my thoughts on Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance.

    I first heard about this book when I was in Portland back in <a href="/2015/10.3/3oct15.html">October</a>. The book came up during brunch and I was very intrigued. So I put a hold at the library for this book once I got back from Portland and after 3 months, my turn had arrived.

    The book starts with a brief history of how couples met before the internet and then dives into how romance has changed in part thanks to the internet. One of  favorite parts of the book were insights from popular dating websites. For dating websites, algorithms are usually touted as the special sauce to finding true love. You fill out a questionnaire and then an algorithm will find a match for you. The interesting phenomenom that the data experts found is people's behavior don't match their answers. The example the book gave was a man would answer on the questionnaire that he prefer a brown hair woman who was shorter than himself but then you check the women he messaged. Some of these women would be blonde and taller than him.

    Another one of my favorite parts was how different cultures were using the internet to avoid breaking social norms. For example, certain countries in the Middle East effectively ban flirting in public. The internet, not only provides a way to flirt privately, but also coordinate social gatherings. Hotels (some of which I suspect were built in hopes of cultivating tourism to the Middle East) are a common place for locals to have social gatherings and women thanks to the burqa can attend anonymously. As the book remarked this is a really cool combination of old (burqa) and new (instant messaging) and I think so too.

    Modern Romance was a fun read. I always like reading about human behavior and the romance/intimacy background made the book even more enjoyable. The next book I am reading will be Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.
