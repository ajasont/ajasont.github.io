Amazon had their post-holiday party on Friday at CenturyLink stadium and I had a blast. My guess is the holiday party is after the holidays because the holidays are a very busy shopping season. The party was headlined by Fall Out Boy with Big Data as an opening act. Both were great and entertaining to listen to. The stadium was divided into sections named after cities or states where Amazon operates and each featured some unique food. For example, the Seattle section featured a few local foods like Beecher's mac and cheese and the California section featured fish tacos. Sections also hosted alternative activites like Bingo or personal photo booths.  I ate and drank my way through most of the night and while resting my full belly and reflecting on where I was, I felt so ridiculously happy and grateful.

Saturday was mostly a rest and digest day as I recovered from the excessive eating and drinking because on Sunday I was off to Steven's Pass for another day of snowboarding with my cousin and his girlfriend.

I practiced on the bunny slope and a green circle slope a few times before I went off to try the blue squares. I felt much more comfortable this trip as I stopped being afraid of falling and at the end of the day, I felt really comfortable on a few blue square slopes. While riding the ski lift up, the quiet and serene ride lends itself well to some ruminating. I have been in a reflective mood recently because my performance review is coming up but also because I was extremely grateful for all the fun I had at the company party and while snowboarding. A good chunk of time was spent thinking about how my family never really took these kinds of leisure trips in my youth to save money I suspect, but now the trip is affordable for me at least. Anyways, I hope to go snowboarding a few more times this year as I want to improve so I can feel confident in my ability to link turns and especially in getting off the ski lift without falling. After the sun set, we went to a Korean restaurant for dinner and I realized I had not gone to a Korean restaurant since I left New York City despite there being one literally a block away from my apartment. Korean food does seem to conjure up memories of my life in New York. I never really ate Korean food before going college despite the plethora of Korean restaurants just a short drive away. My college roommates introduced me to Korean food and then another friend and coworker during my time in New York City really solidifed my preference for Korean food. Nevertheless, the nice warm soup along with the  warm memories of New York life were a great way to end the night after a long and fun day of snowboarding.
