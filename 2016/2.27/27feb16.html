<big>Thoughts</big>
<p>On Saturday, I went snowboarding for the last time this winter. I resolved to be more active outdoors for 2016 and so far, I think I am on track. The goal of this resolution was to help me adopt a mindset of "I don't get better not trying". I often let my ego sway my feelings when trying to learn something new. Sometimes when I try to learn something new, if I do not feel competent pretty quickly, I become discouraged and want to stop. My perceived incompetence on public display amplifies my self-consciousness and, subsequently, I want to to quit even more. I am probably not unique in this regard. I think most people feel this way in some domain of their lives. "I don't get better not trying" is my attempt to address this because I want be a better Andy. I want my ego to take a hit and decide to pour in more effort. For example, although embarassing to admit, my first snowboarding trip ended with a snowmobile carrying me down a blue square. That was back in college and I passed over several opportunies over the last 6 years because I was hesistant to try snowboarding again. But this year, I went thrice and now I am able to traverse down the blue square. I fell or got stalled out on a few plateaus here and there, but that's okay. I will work on that next winter.
