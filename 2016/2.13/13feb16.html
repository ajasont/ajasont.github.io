    A few weeks ago, I posted a picture of some Tillamook cheese. I was on their website last week and took this online quiz that entered me into a raffle. I won that raffle and received a gift box. There was an assortment of cool stuff like pencils, journals, pins, and coupons for yogurt, ice cream, and most importantly more cheese! I already enjoyed their cheese and yogurt but this soldifies my brand loyalty.

And speaking of brand loyalty, I love Jack in the Box. My dad's store shared a plaza with one. I have fond memories of their chicken sandwiches and tacos. There will always be a special place in my heart for Jack in the Box and their "We don't make it til you order it" motto. Fortunately for my health over the last few years, there were no Jack in the Box's on the East coast. Although I am now back on the West coast, I am a 20 minute bus ride away from the closest Jack in the Box far enough that I abstain. I, however, indugled this weekend because of free Jumbo Jack Superbowl promotion. After some guilty pleasure, I headed to the International District for their Lunar Festival where I did not take any pictures worth sharing. I got a haircut afterwards potentially incurring bad luck according to Chinese superstitions. Whoops! At least, I used that Chinese New Year luck to to win the Tillamook contest.

    On Sunday night, I met up with my cousin in Bellevue for some ramen. Afterwards, we watched Deadpool. I enjoyed the movie but not enough that I would want to watch it again.
