<center><b>January 9th, 2016 - Reading Resolution</b></center>
<br>
<p>
    This was a quiet weekend filled with running errands and housekeeping. The only mildly interesting event is that I went to the library to print out some documents to mail out. I have not owned a printer since college and at 5 cents a copy, printing at the library was a good way for me to use up some of my spare change. I also returned some books I had checked out which brings me to another goal of mine for this year. I want to read more.
            </p>
<p>
    So far I have only decided on trying to read at least 12 books. I got back into reading thanks to my Kindle and ended up reading quite a few books last year. Anyways the first book of this year is The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox. 
            </p>
<p>
    This book was recommended to me by a colleague who said the book was an important book for manufacturing and supply chain management and even more intriguing the book is not written in a typical business book manner. Instead the book introduces it's core business concept in the form of a fictional story. I felt the first half of the book did a good job explaining the theory of constraints with an entertaining story but afterwards the rest of the book feels much closer to a fiction story trying to wrap up plot points. 
            </p>
<p>                
    For example, there is a marriage subplot wherein the main character's wife leaves him and seems to be considering divorce because the main character is too focused on the problems at his plant. Towards the end, the marriage is saved because the husband spends more time with his wife but I felt that was only because his plant started to become profitable again. Had the plant still been operating at a loss, I do not think the rekindling would have gone so well. I am confused as to why this subplot is in the book. All I could discern out of the relationship dynamic from this book was "when things are good, things are good and when things are bad, things are bad." 
            </p>
<p>
    Despite the romantic subplot, I would still recommend the book as I felt the book's storytelling style was refreshing and the perspective introduced can be useful. I'd also recommend skipping the second half though or at least the parts involving his wife and family life. Anyways the next 2 books my docket for the year is Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and Modern Love by Aziz Ansari.
